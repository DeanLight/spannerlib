        Computes an information extraction relation, returning the result as a normal relation.

        since ie relations may have input free variables, we need to use another relation to determine the inputs
        for ie_relation.
        Each free variable that appears as an ie_relation input term must appear at least once in the
        bounding_relation terms.
        Should the ie relation not have any input free variables, bounding_relation can (but not must) be None

        note the an ie relation is effectively two relations: a relation that defines the inputs to an ie function
        and a relation that filters the output of the ie functions.
        seeing that, we can define a general algorithm for this function:

        1. using the input relation to the ie function, filter "bounding_relation" into a relation who's
        tuples are all of the inputs to the ie function. if the input relation has no free variable terms,
        it is basically a fact, i.e., a single tuple, meaning we could skip this step and just use that tuple
        as an input instead.

        2. run the ie function on each one of the tuples of the relation we created in step 1, and save the
        results to a new relation (the output relation)

        3. use the output relation of the ie function, filter the results we got in step 2 to a new relation

        example:
        let's follow the steps for the ie relation "RGX<X,Y>->(Z,[1,2))" with the bounding relation "bind(X,Y,W)":

        1. input_relation(X,Y) <- bind(X,Y,W)  # filter the bounding relation tuples into the input relation

        2. for each tuple in input_relation(X,Y), use it as an input for RGX(x,y) and save the result to a new
        relation called output_relation

        3. filter the outputs of the ie function into a relation like this
        final_ie_result(X,Y,Z) <- input_relation(X,Y), output_relation(Z,[1,2))
        for details on this join operation see "RgxlogEngineBase.join_relations"

        note that "final_ie_result" is defined using only free variables, as an ie relation in rgxlog is merely
        a part of a rule body, which serves to define the rule head relation. the rule head only "cares" about
        free variables, so we can throw away all of the columns defined by constant terms.

        The reason for having three columns instead of two is to ensure that we have an answer for every query pertaining to the grandparent rule. <br>

        a rule can be defined multiple times as long as it shares the same rule head. To illustrate this, let's consider the following example:

        Suppose we have the rules:
        ```prolog
        A(X,Y) <- B(X,Y)
        A(X,Y) <- C(X,Y)
        ```
        If we execute the query `?A(X,Y)`, the engine will produce results that include tuples from both `B(X,Y)` and `C(X,Y)` relations. 

        Here's how the engine handles this scenario: <br>
        1. **Rule Matching**: The engine identifies all the rules that have the same rule head (`A(X,Y)`) as the queried relation. <br>
        2. **Rule Execution**: For each matched rule, the engine executes all the steps described earlier, such as assigning temporary names, performing joins, and creating intermediate relations, selecting and filtering. <br>
        3. **Intermediate Relations**: At this stage, we have intermediate relations generated for each rule, containing the relevant tuples based on the rule's body. <br>
        4. **Operator Union**: To consolidate the results from all the rules into a single unified relation, the operator union is applied. This operation combines the tuples from all the intermediate relations. <br>
       
        The `operator_union` ensures that the final unified relation contains all the tuples from the individual intermediate relations, effectively merging the results obtained from different rule instances with the same rule head.
        In summary, the engine processes each rule with the same rule head as the queried relation, performs the necessary steps for each rule individually, and then applies the operator union to merge the intermediate relations into a single unified relation, ensuring all relevant tuples are included in the final result.        @note: we assume that all the relations have same free_vars in the same order.
