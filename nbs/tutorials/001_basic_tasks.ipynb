    "The distance between stars is measured in astronomical units (AU), parsecs (pc), or light-years (ly). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Astronomical Unit (AU)**: An AU is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is approximately 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. It is more commonly used to measure distances within our solar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parsec (pc)**: A parsec is a unit of distance used in astronomy, defined as the distance at which an object would have a parallax angle of one arcsecond. One parsec is equal to approximately 3.26 light-years or 3.09 x 10^13 kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Light-year (ly)**: A light-year is the distance that light travels in one year, which is approximately 9.46 trillion kilometers or about 5.88 trillion miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the distance to a star, astronomers use methods such as parallax and spectroscopic parallax. Parallax involves observing a star from two different points in Earth's orbit and measuring the apparent shift in position. Spectroscopic parallax uses the star's spectral type and luminosity to estimate its distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, astronomers use a combination of trigonometric and spectroscopic methods to measure the distance between stars in order to better understand the vastness of our universe.\n",

    "\n",
    "The parallax angle, denoted by p, is the angle formed between a line from the observer to the nearer star and a line from the observer to the farther star. The parallax angle is related to the distance to the star (d) by the formula:\n",

      "1. **Astronomical Unit (AU)**: An AU is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is approximately 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. It is more commonly used to measure distances within our solar system.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Parsec (pc)**: A parsec is a unit of distance used in astronomy, defined as the distance at which an object would have a parallax angle of one arcsecond. One parsec is equal to approximately 3.26 light-years or 3.09 x 10^13 kilometers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Light-year (ly)**: A light-year is the distance that light travels in one year, which is approximately 9.46 trillion kilometers or about 5.88 trillion miles.\n",
      "\n",
      "To measure the distance to a star, astronomers use methods such as parallax and spectroscopic parallax. Parallax involves observing a star from two different points in Earth's orbit and measuring the apparent shift in position. Spectroscopic parallax uses the star's spectral type and luminosity to estimate its distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, astronomers use a combination of trigonometric and spectroscopic methods to measure the distance between stars in order to better understand the vastness of our universe.\n",
