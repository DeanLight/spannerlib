    "In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of re-writing an existing data pipeline into the rgxlog framework, allowing you to witness a real-world example of the framework's benefits. And to offer further tutorials on advanced applications of the rgxlog framework.\n",
    "We've chosen to adapt a pipeline from the field of NLP, specifically the Covid-19 NLP pipeline, which was a part of a published [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.nlpcovid19-acl.10.pdf) in 2020."

    "\n",
    "The pipline repository [link](https://github.com/abchapman93/VA_COVID-19_NLP_BSV/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the NLP pipeline is to identify individuals who have been positively diagnosed with COVID-19 by extracting pertinent information from unstructured free-text narratives found within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). By automating this process, the pipeline streamlines the screening of a substantial volume of clinical text, significantly reducing the time and effort required for identification.\n",
    "The pipeline is built on medSpacy framework, and defines a new UI to use."

    "### Pipline Stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "![pipeline_flowchart](img/pipeline_flowchart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- preprocessor: Modifies the preprocessed text\n",
    "- concept tagger: Assigns a semantic tag in a custom attribute to each Token, which helps with concept extraction and normalization.\n",
    "- target matcher: Extracts spans using rules, based on the concept tagger.\n",
    "- sectionizer: Identifies note section headers in the text and assigns section titles to entities and tokens contained in that section.\n",
    "- context: Identifies semantic modifiers of entities and asserts attributes such as positive status, negation, and other experiencier.\n",
    "- postprocessor: Modifies or removes the entity based on business logic. This handles special cases or complex logic using the results of earlier stages.\n",
    "- document classifier: Assigns a label of \"POS\", \"UNK\", or \"NEG\" to each file, A document will be classified as positive if it has at least one positive, non-excluded entity\n",
    "We will explain about each stage in more details later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each stage, we encountered unique challenges. Each stage involved working with different classes and medSpacy framework attributes. Our approach was to first understand the original implementation, seek opportunities to simplify it, and then rewrite it in rgxlog. What was possible we wrote it declaratively using rules, facts, and queries. Additionally, if any essential functionalities were missing in the library, we built IE functions.\n",
    "As we mentioned the pipline uses medSpacy framework so first we need to import some libraries and install some requirements."

    "\n",
    "The postprocessor is designed to apply extra adjustments to the processed text using custom logic or specific requirements not addressed by the spaCy pipeline. These rules modify, remove, or change attributes for each mention of COVID-19 based on either their existing attributes, the context of the sentences in which they appear, or a combination of both. This flexibility allows us to address data issues and implement targeted improvements. For instance, it proves useful in identifying and rectifying incorrectly labeled positive cases, thereby enhancing the accuracy of our classification.\n",

    "**How we implemented it:**  \n",
    "As mentioned earlier, postprocess rules are responsible for modifying, removing, or changing attributes for each mention of COVID-19. In the original project, these attributes are represented as boolean variables stored in an object class for each COVID-19 mention. The rules simply switch the corresponding boolean variable to assign or remove the attribute. However, in rgxlog, we don't have the luxury of creating classes. In our project, when we want to remove a specific attribute, we introduce an additional attribute that acts as its negation. For instance, for the attribute 'positive,' we add 'no_positive,' causing the document classifier to behave as if there is no positive attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in some cases, the entire COVID-19 mention is removed by eliminating its object. In our project, we introduce an 'IGNORE' attribute, which results in the exclusion of the mention from consideration in the document classifier stage.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the subsequent cells, we will explore three types of postprocess rules:**\n",
    "1) Rules based on patterns\n",

    "3) Rules applied to the next sentence."
