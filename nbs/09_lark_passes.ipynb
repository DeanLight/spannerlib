    "Each pass inherits from one of the following classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transformer - Takes a lark tree as an input and returns a completely new lark tree. The order of the nodes\n",
    "that are visited could be defined by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Visitor/Visitor_Recursive - Takes a lark tree as an input. If changes are performed to the lark tree,\n",
    "they are done in place. The order in which the visitor visits the nodes is not defined, so you should only\n",
    "use this class if you want to visit nodes without any context. Visitor_Recursive is mostly used because\n",
    "according to the documentation it is faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interpreter - Same as 'Visitor', only the order of node is defined (by default it is bfs from the root\n",
    "of the lark tree, hence the name interpreter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some relevant links that will allow you to learn about lark.\n",
