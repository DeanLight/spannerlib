    "## Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where is all the data about the relations stored?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data about relations is stored in a SQLite3 database. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **SQLite3**: A module in Python's standard library that offers a lightweight and self-contained relational database management system. It enables creating, connecting to, and manipulating SQLite databases using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database Table Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### What specific data is stored in the db tables, and what is the structure of these tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a relation is defined, a corresponding table is created in the database. <br>\n",
    "The table has the same name as the relation, and its columns correspond to the variables in the relation—i.e., `len(term_list)`.\n",
    "the names of columns in the database don't have an informative name and there is no need because from Python's perspective it doesn't understand what the relation or its values mean, it just sorts information in the way they were provided, for example brothers(\"Jack\",\"Michael\") from Python's perspective it just sees that \"Jack\" is the first term so it puts it in the col0 and \"Michael\" is the second so it gets added to col1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we define a new relation `brothers(str, str)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "%%rgxlog\n",
    "new brothers(str, str)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The engine will create for us a new table for relation `brothers` with two columns called col0 and col1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules and Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Do Rules and Queries Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new rule is added to the system, an empty table is created in the database. <br> \n",
    "This table remains empty initially because multiple rules can share the same rule head. <br> \n",
    "During the querying process, the engine iterates through the list of rules, and the query result is a logical OR of these rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we define the rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "A(X,Y) <- B(X,Y)\n",
    "A(X,Y) <- C(X,Y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "result would include all tuples that satisfy either `B(X, Y)` OR `C(X, Y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Decomposition and Rule Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand querying in-depth, it's beneficial to break down a rule into its constituent parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Grandparent Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider the rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "grandparent(X, Z) <- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z)\n",
    "```\n",
    "*the rule head*: grandparent(X,Z) <br>\n",
    "*the rule body*: relations: [parent(X,Y), parent(Y,Z)]\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 operators in the engine that get called when breaking that rule, we will break down each one of them below."

    "        a rule can be defined multiple times as long as it shares the same rule head. To illustrate this, let's consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Suppose we have the rules:\n",
    "        ```prolog\n",
    "        A(X,Y) <- B(X,Y)\n",
    "        A(X,Y) <- C(X,Y)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        If we execute the query `?A(X,Y)`, the engine will produce results that include tuples from both `B(X,Y)` and `C(X,Y)` relations. \n",
    "\n",
    "        Here's how the engine handles this scenario: <br>\n",
    "        1. **Rule Matching**: The engine identifies all the rules that have the same rule head (`A(X,Y)`) as the queried relation. <br>\n",
    "        2. **Rule Execution**: For each matched rule, the engine executes all the steps described earlier, such as assigning temporary names, performing joins, and creating intermediate relations, selecting and filtering. <br>\n",
    "        3. **Intermediate Relations**: At this stage, we have intermediate relations generated for each rule, containing the relevant tuples based on the rule's body. <br>\n",
    "        4. **Operator Union**: To consolidate the results from all the rules into a single unified relation, the operator union is applied. This operation combines the tuples from all the intermediate relations. <br>\n",
    "       \n",
    "        The `operator_union` ensures that the final unified relation contains all the tuples from the individual intermediate relations, effectively merging the results obtained from different rule instances with the same rule head.\n",
    "        In summary, the engine processes each rule with the same rule head as the queried relation, performs the necessary steps for each rule individually, and then applies the operator union to merge the intermediate relations into a single unified relation, ensuring all relevant tuples are included in the final result.        @note: we assume that all the relations have same free_vars in the same order.\n",
