    Executes a parse graph
    this execution is generic, meaning it does not require any specific kind of term graph, symbol table or
    spannerlog engine in order to work. <br>
    This execution performs no special optimization and merely serves as an interface between the term graph
    and the spannerlog engine.

    The main idea behind this class is that it uses the `term_graph` to understand how relations are related to
    one another, and thanks to that information, it is able to execute the commands in the `parse_graph`.
    for example, let's say the parse graph looks like this:

    ```prolog
    (root) -> (query relation a)
    ```

    and the term graph looks like this:

    ```prolog
    (a)  --> union --> (b)
                   --> (c)
    ```
    
    the execution class will perform a union over `b` and `c`, and put it in a new relation, let's say `union_b_c`.
    then it will copy `union_b_c` into `a`, and finally it will query `a` and return the result.

    more precisely, the execution traverses the parse tree, when it reaches a query node it compute the relevant
    relation using the term graph (i.e. if the query is `?A(X)` it will compute the relation `A`).
    read the documentation of `compute_rule` function to understand how the computation is done.

    """
    # TODO agg - can we maker recursion check also an explicit computation node?
    # so we can have the computation graph be made explicit here?

    
    # it's an inner function because it needs to access all naive_execution's params
    def compute_rule(relation_name: str, do_reset: bool = True) -> None:
        """
        Computes the rule (including the mutual recursive rules).
        This function traverses the term graph and dynamically generates the computation graph of the rule (note that we
        don't really create a computational graph object; it's more of a conceptual thing).
        During the traversal, when we reach a root of another rule relation, we build its computational graph as well.
        We do that in the following way:
            * if the relation is mutually recursive, we use its current value.
            * if the relation isn't mutually recursive, we compute it recursively (calling compute_rule on it).

        Finally, we compute together all the mutually recursive relations in the following way:
            we iterate over all the mutually recursive relations:
                each relation is computed using the current states of its mutually recursive relations
            we stop iterating only after there was no change in all the mutually recursive relations at the same
            iteration (we reach a fixed point).

        the following abstract example might help understand this process:
        let's say we have 2 mutually recursive relations, `a` and `b`, which depend on one another:
        ...
        a(X) <- b(X)
        ...
        b(X) <- a(X)
        ...

        at the beginning, the imaginary relations a_0 and b_0 are empty.
        during the first iteration, the imaginary relation a_1 is created, and it may contain some rows of data (based on the rules).
        then b_1 is created, and it is affected by a_1 (because of the rule `b(X) <- a(X)`), so it will have all of a_1's rows, maybe more.
        after `i` iterations, a_i and b_i are not changed, and therefore we reached a fixed point. now we stop iteration,
        and relations `a` and `b` are `COMPUTED`.
