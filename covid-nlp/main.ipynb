    "### Inroduction:\n",
    "The primary objective of the NLP pipeline is to identify individuals who have been positively diagnosed with COVID-19 by extracting pertinent information from unstructured free-text narratives found within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). By automating this process, the pipeline streamlines the screening of a substantial volume of clinical text, significantly reducing the time and effort required for identification.\n",
    "The pipeline is built on medSpacy framework, and defines a new UI to use.\n",
    "Our goal is to write the pipline in rgxlog language so we show a real world example about the benefits of the rgxlog framework from the NLP world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### pipline stages:\n",
    "- [Concept tagger](#concept-tag-rules)\n",
    "- [Target matcher](#target-rules)\n",
    "- [Context matcher](#context-rules)\n",
    "- Sectionizer\n",
    "- Postprocessor\n",
    "- Document classification\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement each stage separately later on."
